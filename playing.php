<h1>Playing games on the league</h1>
<p>We'd like to clarify how games should be played on the league to avoid confusion.
(Please note that this is the current version, modified in practice and takes priority over the original specification at
<a href="http://league.britgo.org/doc/LeagueDescription.pdf" target="_blank">this document</a>).
</p>
<p><b>If something goes wrong</b> please see <a href="#wrong">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Standard Even Games</h2>
<p>Games should be played with the following parameters on KGS
</p>
<ul>
<li>AGA Rules</li>
<li>No handicap</li>
<li>7.5 Komi</li>
<li>Free Game</li>
<li>Colours assigned <u>as specified in the match allocation</u> not according to strengths
of players</li>
<li>Byo-Yomi time control</li>
<li>Main time 30 minutes</li>
<li>Byo-Yomi time 30 seconds</li>
<li>5 Byo-Yomi periods</li>
<li>Indicate that it's a BGA League Game</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a correct setting for "Custom Game" which should be in
the British Room:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/gamesetup.png" width="348" height="469" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="20" alt="KGS Go Screen">
</div>
<?php
$luh = $hdiv - 1;

// $luh is "last un-handicapped"

if ($luh > 0)  {
	if ($hdiv <= $md)  {		//  Some have handicaps
		print "<h2>Team League Division";
		if ($luh == 1)
			 print " 1</h2>\n";
		elseif ($luh == 2)
			print "s 1 and 2</h2>\n";
		else
			print "s 1 to $luh</h2>\n";
	}
	print <<<EOT
<p>
All games are played even.
Please try to stick to the colours as they are assigned WBW or BWB to boards 1 to 3
regardless of strengths. One player
may have to click the button next to his name to get the colours right.</p>

EOT;
	if ($hdiv <= $md)
		print <<<EOT
<h2>League Divisions $hdiv and below</h2>
<p>These divisions may have handicap games where the player strengths are sufficiently
different, otherwise they should be even as described above.
Please try to stick to the colours as they are assigned WBW or BWB to boards 1 to 3
regardless of strengths (wherever this is possible). One player
may have to click the button next to his name to get the colours right.</p>
</p>
EOT;
}
else {
	print <<<EOT

if ($hdiv <= $md) {
	$hred = $pars->Hreduct;
	$diff = 9 - $hred;
	print <<<EOT
<h2>Playing handicap games</h2>
<p>Handicaps are assigned as the difference in rank minus $hred up to a maximum of 9.
A handicap of 1 means no komi. If the difference in rank is less than $hred, then the game is
played as even with 7.5 komi and possibly with the weaker player as White.</p>
<p>So for example if a 1K player plays a 10K player then

EOT;
	phcp($hred, 9);
	print <<<EOT
</p>
<p>Or if a 2D player plays a 4K player then

EOT;
	phcp($hred, 5);
	print <<<EOT
</p>

EOT;
}
?>
<p>The komi on handicap games should be set to 0.5 except for handicaps beyond 9, as described below.
<h3>Handicaps beyond 9</h3>
<p>If the handicap "would be" more than 9, then the white player gives 9 stones plus 10 points
of reverse komi for each stone beyond 9. This might mean that the komi is -9.5, -19.5 etc.</p>
<p>So for example if a 1K player plays a 20K player then
<?php
phcp($hred, 19);
?>
</p>
<h3>Handicap display</h3>
<p>The software calculates the handicap "on the fly" from the currently-set ranks of the players. It is each player's
responsibility to make sure that his/her rank is set correctly (each player can adjust his/her own rank). The players
should be prepared to adjust the handicap before the start of the game if they know it is too much or too little to make
the games as fair as possible.</p>
<h2>General points</h2>
<p>We suggest a "Free Game" as the KGS handicaps are ignored and in some cases wildly different
strength players meet with non-standard handicaps
and we don't think this should confuse KGS rankings.</p>
<p>If you suddenly realise during the game you've got the game settings wrong you must continue
with it if 6 or more moves have been played. If you have played less than 6 moves you may abandon the
game and restart it.
</p>
<p>If there is an unavoidable interruption such as one player is disconnected or KGS crashes,
please try to resume it as soon as possible
or agree the result by one side resigning possibly in consultation
with an agreed adjudicator.</p>
<p>If it is impossible to resume the game and it appears very close, record the game as
a draw (Jigo). (This is why a column has been provided for draws in the tables -
and potentially a team match could be drawn also).</p>
<a name="wrong"></a>
<h1>Something wrong?</h1>
<p>If something goes wrong, please don't flounder.
Please don't enter any results that may be trouble to unravel.
Here's what to do.
</p>
<h2>Errors setting up the game</h2>
<p>If you make a mistake setting up the game, such as getting the colours, handicap (if any), time limits or komi wrong and you notice
the error, you should abandon the game and restart it <b>if less than 6 moves have been made</b>.</p>
<p>If 6 or more moves have been made, then the settings must stand and the result reported as the server
announces it.</p>
<p>You must abandon the game, not have one side resign if the colours are wrong at the start, as if someone just resigns it may
confuse the algorithm to load the SGF from KGS, and mistakenly load that one rather than the "real" one.</p>
<p>This is another reason why games should be "free" so that abandoned games don't make the players
get tagged as "escapers".</p>
<h2>At the end of the game</h2>
<p>Please be careful to correctly mark dead groups before pressing "done". If you can't agree about
which groups are dead, play out the moves to prove it one way or another. This doesn't matter under AGA rules.
If you get it wrong you <b>cannot</b> change the result from what the server announces.</p>
<h2>Disputes about playing games</h2>
<p>If you think that a handicap is wrong, because you are overgraded or your opponent
undergraded, <b>do not start the game</b> or the outcome will be counted as the result.
Query the matter immediately with your team captains or an administrator.</p>
<p>A dispute may arise about people not turning up for games or some irregularity during a
game.</p>
<p>If this happens please contact an admin person or BGA council member as soon as possible as
referee. The person chosen should not have any direct involvement with the match in question
and should refuse to act as referee if he/she believes that there is any such involvement.</p>
<p>The person may decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>To award the game to one side or the other.</li>
<li>To declare the game to be a draw (Jigo). Note that this may cause the match itself
to be drawn.</li>
<li>To declare the game void and order its replay. The replay should normally be with the same
colours, handicap or komi
and time controls as the original game should have been (unless some of those were issues
in dispute).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last case, the referee may supplement his/her decision
with a rider that a replay be made within a certain time or one of the other
outcomes shall apply.
</p>
<p>If you think that the decision of the referee was wrong, or that the referee had
an undeclared interest in the result, then you should appeal to the BGA council for
a final decision.</p>
<p>Games decided in this fashion (unless the referee decides that the result of the game
should stand as it was) are entered as <b>W+N</b> or <b>B+N</b>
or <b>Jigo</b> as appropriate and no SGF file should be included.</p>
<h2>Errors entering results</h2>
<p>The result must be entered exactly as reported by the server. We now let you correct incorrect
colours, but please don't make a habit of this.</p>
<p>If you realise you have made a major error in the reporting of a result, please stop entering anything
else, but report the matter to an admin person for him/her to correct.</p>
<h1>Ordering of league tables</h1>
<p>To clarify how the league tables are ordered, the rules are as follows:</p>
<h2>League Table ordering</h2>
<ul>
<?php
print <<<EOT
<li>For each match won, we give {$pars->Won} points.</li>
<li>For each match drawn (this can happen if some games were drawn),
we give {$pars->Drawn} points.</li>
<li>For each match lost, we give {$pars->Lost} points.</li>
<li>For each match played and completed, whatever the outcome,
we give {$pars->Played} points.</li>
<li>For each individual game, we give {$pars->Forg} point(s) for each won game and
{$pars->Againstg} for each lost game. Drawn games are given {$pars->Drawng} point(s),
</li>

EOT;
?>
</ul>
<p>The intention of this is to give most credit for matches completed and won. If those
compare equal, we use the number of individual games won. However we try to give
some credit to matches actually completed even if they are lost.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we would suggest that the league tables should not be taken
too seriously in the early parts of the season.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the season, we try to encourage teams to complete matches
and may mark games as drawn or defaulted by one side as appropriate.</p>
